# Online-Exam-Cheating-Detection
This project aims at detecting cheating during online exams with help of deep learning algorithms on video stream.

Approach:
1. Create a backbone.
2. Predict different tasks.
3. Deploy algorithms to process above predictions to predict different metrics that are indicaative of cheating.

NN Predictions: 
1. Bounding box 
2. Direction of face 
3. Gender 
4. Person photo identification
5. 

Product outputs:
1. anti spoofing 
2. some cheating metrics
